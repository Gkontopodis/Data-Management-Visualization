# Developing a Research Question and Creating a Personal Code Book

## Introduction

After reviewing the codebook of NESARC, a survey in over  43093 U.S. citizens (over the age of 18) designed to determine the magnitude  of alcohol use and psychiatric disorders, I found myself particularly interested in cannabis use disorders. More specifically I aim to examine the  patterns of association between cannabis use, and major depression as well as general anxiety disorder diagnosed in the last 12 months. Nowadays, cannabis is the most widely consumed drug in many countries, however there is also a medical use of it. It has been estimated that around 10% of people who use cannabis will become depended upon it [4]. It is common knowledge that there is a strong relationship between mental disorders and alcohol abuse, therefore it is a matter of interest whether cannabisâ€™ frequent use co-occurs with depression and generalized anxiety.
